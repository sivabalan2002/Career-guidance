                <h1>computer science</h1>
                <p>computer science, the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations,<br> hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes<br> the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes,<br> and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering<br> and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and<br> electronic circuit design</p>

                <h1>biology</h1>
                <p>biology, study of living things and their vital processes. The field deals with all the physicochemical aspects<br> of life. The modern tendency toward cross-disciplinary research and the unification of scientific knowledge<br> and investigation from different fields has resulted in significant overlap of the field of biology with other<br> scientific disciplines. Modern principles of other fields—chemistry, medicine, and physics, for example—are<br> integrated with those of biology in areas such as biochemistry, biomedicine, and biophysics.</p>

                <h1>pure science</h1>
                <p>Pure Science is the development of scientific theories and predictions in three broad subjects: Chemistry,<br> Biology or Physics. Also known as ‘Basic Science’ or ‘Natural Science’, Pure Science is research which doesn’t<br> consider how these theories can be applied but is used to answer questions or phenomena. Pure Sciences usually<br> take place in a laboratory setting.</p>

                <h1>business commerce</h1>
                <p>Commerce is the exchange of goods or services among two or more parties. It is the subset of business that focuses<br> on the sale of finished or unfinished products rather than their sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, or<br> marketing.</p>
